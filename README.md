# Scapy docker image

This image provides [scapy](https://scapy.net/) on a alpine image for network analysis
and testing purposes. For convenient interactive sessions, IPython is
included as well.

As both scapy and IPython are only available on alpine's edge branch, that has
to be used as base image rather than a stable version.
